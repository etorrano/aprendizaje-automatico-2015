Se debe proponer algún modo de tratar el texto, con eventuales mejoras respecto a la vectorización de la parte 1. Se deben aplicar clasificadores y medir su performance, mínimamente con precision, recall y medida-F. Finalmente, se espera una discusión detallada de todo lo realizado y eventuales propuestas de mejora."

      "proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut\n",
      "the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.\n",
      "    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore\n",
      "off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion\n",
